# Password-Generator-Challenge

Creating a password generator for this JavaScript challenge was definitely a test! Researching and checking MDN Web Docs to learn and see what each function should be doing was critical for me, piece by piece things were being built out and as I went along I wrote many detailed comments to look back and understand how it all came together. Some of the requirements were a user has to choose between a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128. They are then prompted with different criteria they would like their password to have. Finally, at the end, a user gets a secure and randomized password!
